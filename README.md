# Predicting-YouTube-Channel-Popularity-and-Profitability


**Introduction**

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the INSY662 Team 4 project, focused on predicting the popularity and profitability of YouTube channels. This project is a collaborative effort by Xiaorong Tian, Jiaxuan Wang, Siqi Wang, Hongyi Zhan, and Kelly Kao.

**Project Overview**

Our project dives into the dynamic world of digital advertising, specifically on YouTube. We aim to understand the factors influencing the effectiveness and efficiency of digital ads, measured in terms of Cost Per Mille (CPM) and Growth Potential. These insights are vital for stakeholders like advertisers, marketers, video creators, and video platforms, all of whom seek to maximize their return on investment, optimize ad revenue, and attract more advertisers.

**Objectives and Goals**

The primary objective of our project is to analyze how various factors - including audience demographics, content quality, ad placement, and market trends - affect CPM and growth potential in digital advertising. Our expected outcomes include developing insights for more efficient ad spending, improving ad targeting strategies, and enhancing revenue generation models​​.

**Data and Methodology**

We utilize a comprehensive dataset containing 28 columns and 996 rows, offering detailed information about YouTube channels and the demographic data of the regions they belong to. This dataset includes both numerical variables (like subscriber counts, video views, monthly and yearly earnings) and categorical variables (such as country and channel type).

Our findings highlight significant correlations between demographic data and channel performance, revealing a substantial gap in income and performance among YouTubers. We discovered that a YouTuber's performance is highly dependent on their channel category​.

The core of our analysis revolves around two target variables: CPM and Growth Potential. CPM is calculated using a formula involving yearly earnings and video views, while Growth Potential is derived from a formula involving monthly earnings and subscriber counts​.

Our process flow includes several analytical steps such as anomaly detection, multicollinearity checks, and the use of various statistical models like Random Forest, Lasso Selection, Linear Mixed-effects Model, and Elastic Net Regression​.

**Applications and Benefits**

Our solutions are designed to assist various stakeholders in the YouTube ecosystem. Marketers can identify crucial factors for collaboration with content creators, optimize investment portfolios, and refine marketing strategies for maximum ROI. Creators can conduct thorough performance reviews, focus on profitability-enhancing factors, and gain bargaining power in advertising negotiations. Platforms can gain deeper insights into creator dynamics, identify beneficial predictors for channel success, and develop customized growth strategies, thereby enhancing their appeal to advertisers​.
